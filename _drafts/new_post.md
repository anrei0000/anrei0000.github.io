	Ackerman sequence
	* 1: addition
	1 + 1

	* 2: multiplication
	2 * 2

	* 3: exponentiation: 3 exponentiated to the 3rd means repeated addition
	3^3

	* 4: tetration: 4 tetrated to the 4th means repeated exponentiation. this number has 10^154 digits.
	4^4^4^4

	* 5: pentation: 5 pentated to the 5th means repeated tetration
	(5^5^5^5)^ (5^5^5^5)^ (5^5^5^5)^ (5^5^5^5)^ (5^5^5^5)

	* 6: hextation: 6 hextated to the 6th means:

	Indeed, one could define science as reason’s attempt to compensate for our inability to perceive big numbers. If we could run at 280,000,000 meters per second, there’d be no need for a special theory of relativity: it’d be obvious to everyone that the faster we go, the heavier and squatter we get, and the faster time elapses in the rest of the world. If we could live for 70,000,000 years, there’d be no theory of evolution, and certainly no creationism: we could watch speciation and adaptation with our eyes, instead of painstakingly reconstructing events from fossils and DNA. If we could bake bread at 20,000,000 degrees Kelvin, nuclear fusion would be not the esoteric domain of physicists but ordinary household knowledge. But we can’t do any of these things, and so we have science, to deduce about the gargantuan what we, with our infinitesimal faculties, will never sense. If people fear big numbers, is it any wonder that they fear science as well and turn for solace to the comforting smallness of mysticism?

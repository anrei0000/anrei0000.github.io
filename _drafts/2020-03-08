## how to be cool with programing
some days you are in the zone. other times not so much. everyone has some experience of this in their own special way. doesn’t really have to be IT. doesn’t even really have to be work. i believe it’s always about myself this conversation should be aimed at. 

how cool am I with the stuff in my life? how much of the same me do i bring in my work? it got really simple once i accepted (i hope i did) that “me” is the same everywhere.

so the point here is know yourself. from that follows naturally the follow-up question how to be cool with anything. as such i might give the personal answer that it’s really fun when I’m doing deep work i know, it’s really stressful when simple things don’t work, it’s really exciting when i practice complex things.

how cool are you with programming?

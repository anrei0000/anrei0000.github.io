Yuhu, so you want to take a short trekking trip! And you never went on one before! 

About your 2 day trip in Romanian summer: travel from Bucharest to the mountains; light trek first day; sleeping in tent; light trek second day; travel from the mountains back to Bucharest

My checklist bottom up
* boots
I use Salomon and my feet are happy 'cos they fit my feet really well. Your foot is different, test first. Buy 1.5 size bigger than regular street shoes.
* socks x2
2 pairs of synthetic trekking socks. 'cos they don't break and keep my feet happy. cotton works as well
* underwear x2
2 pairs of synthetic stretchy boxers. 'cos they don't break and keep me happy. cotton works as well
* pants
long thin pants. thin cotton pants work as well but also bring shorts in case you get too hot. pro tips: can turn to shorts, have elasic/string near ankle, fast dry, reinforced knees and butt, UV resistant, breathable
* tshirt x2
fast dry tshirt, the kind you use in the gym, I used cotton for years so it works as well. pro tips: regular fit not slim fit, I use a short sleeve shirt which also has 2 useful pockets, and I can also unbutton it to control heat.
* rain jacket
I use a thin jacket which is waterproof and breathable, from Milo. I used rain coats (the ones long to the knees from decathlon) instead and they do the job as well. pro tips: have armpit zipper for heat control, have an adjustable hood so you can wear it and still see. 	
* long sleeve tshirt (optional)
I will bring a thin merino wool long sleeve blouse. I can use this in daytime walking to prevent sunburn - but usually don't cos it's still hot; dusk-nighttime - it's super cosy

General tips:
* I have special mountain gear which I can tear, stain, wear extensively, wear broken, know multiple ways to wear because it bring a huge freedom benefit to my mind.

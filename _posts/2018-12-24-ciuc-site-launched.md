Yuhu, I made a new thing !

To put this site together I used:
* github pages
I made a new project with the name anrei0000.github.io for which I enabled github pages which in turn uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static site content.
* travis-ci
I connected [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/anrei0000/anrei0000.github.io/builds) to my github account to track my deployments. After this I also found out about [github's deployments](https://github.com/anrei0000/anrei0000.github.io/deployments) so I guess maybe I can use both.
* [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is the templating engine used by Jekyll. I am testing funtionality for this since I have only shortly viewed the docs for it.

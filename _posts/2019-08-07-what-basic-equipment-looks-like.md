Yuhu, so you want to take a short trekking trip! And you never went on one before! 

About your 2 day trip in Romanian summer: travel from Bucharest to the mountains; light trek first day; sleeping in tent; light trek second day; travel from the mountains back to Bucharest.

# Day 1
My checklist for the first day applies also if I would just do a same-day return trip.

* boots - [Salomon 4D 2 GTX](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/quest-4d-3-gtxr.html#1191=9861)

I use Salomon and my feet are happy 'cos they fit my feet really well. Your foot is different, test first. Buy 1.5 size bigger than regular street shoes.

* socks x2

2 pairs of synthetic trekking socks. 'cos they don't break and keep my feet happy. cotton works as well

* underwear x2

2 pairs of synthetic stretchy boxers. 'cos they don't break and keep me happy. cotton works as well

* pants

Long thin pants. thin cotton pants work as well but also bring shorts in case you get too hot. pro tips: can turn to shorts, have elasic/string near ankle, fast dry, reinforced knees and butt, UV resistant, breathable

* tshirt x2

Fast dry tshirt, the kind you use in the gym, I used cotton for years so it works as well. pro tips: regular fit not slim fit, I use a short sleeve shirt which also has 2 useful pockets, and I can also unbutton it to control heat.

* rain jacket - [Milo Mouro](https://www.nootkasport.ro/imbracaminte-barbati/imbracaminte/geci-de-trekking--87/geaca-milo-mouro--34497.htm)

I use a thin jacket which is waterproof and breathable, from Milo. I used rain coats (the ones long to the knees from decathlon) instead and they do the job as well. pro tips: have armpit zipper for heat control, have an adjustable hood which you can wear it and still see. 	

* long sleeve merino tshirt

I will bring a thin merino wool long sleeve blouse. I can use this in daytime walking to prevent sunburn - but usually don't cos it's still hot; helps with dusk-nighttime chill plus it's super cosy.

* small gear

hat, bandana

* small tools

knife, headlamp, external battery, phone charger

* health kit / emergency kit

toothbrush, paste, soap, toilet paper, wet wipes, blister patches, crayon, paper, backup lighter, cotton wad, needle, thread, elastic wrap for sprains, sunscreen, medicinal alcohol or an iodine solution

* water

2L per person per day minimum for me is the rule. If there is no water source double that.

* food

Morning 2x sandwitches. 

2x snacks before lunch: nuts of all kinds, banana, dehydrated fruit (plum). 

Lunch: some hard cheese, bell pepper, olives, more fruit

snack after lunch: chocolate bar, peach.

dinner: hopefully meat, bread, potatoes over the fire

* backpack - [Simond](https://www.simond.com/jorasses-backpack-40-l-id_8241621)

All the above will fit in a 40L pack with spare room. The link is the closest match I could find to what I have.


# Day 2
Day 1 items plus some more, according to weather.

* tent

We have an old 3 person dome tent which has seen better days but it works. At some point it'll get an upgrade, but it's perfect for 2 people with packs.

* sleeping bag - [Fjord Nansen](https://www.fjordnansen.pl/product-eng-23009-FINMARK-MID-4-C-850g-sleeping-bag.html)

Has served me great and is super lightweight. Also, my body takes cold better than heat, I've also used this in the winter time... with a _lot_ of extra layers and some shivering :)) 

* fleece jacket

My Mammut fleece is looking just a bit worn but still awesome even after about 3 years of constant wear. Closest [match](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mammut-Phase-Mens-Jacket-blue/dp/B00XCZUSRU/ref=sr_1_58?qid=1565202011&refinements=p_89%3AMammut&s=camping-hiking&sr=1-58&th=1).

* fleece pants

They work great for chilly evenings in front of the tent as well as in the sleeping bag.

* down jacket - [Ternua Sefton](https://www.ternua.com/com/sefton-jacket-1642670-2287.html)

I will usually think twice about bringing this, then bring it anyway. Ternua have awesome gear and this packes super small. A rule for any down jacket is the more sowing lines it has, the less warm it is.

# Final thoughts
* I have special mountain gear which I can tear, stain, wear extensively, wear broken, know multiple ways to wear. My gear helps bring a huge freedom benefit to my mind.
* Function over form; reuse recycle
* Enjoy nature, sunny trails!
